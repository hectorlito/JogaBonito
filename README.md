# JogaBonito

App to create and track pick up gamaes in your local community.

### Deployment

Heroku is a cloud platform that was used to host our web application. To view live, visit https://jogabonito08.herokuapp.com/

### Utilizing
 - MongoDB/Mongoose
 - Express
 - Node
 - Angular
 - HTML
 - CSS(BootStrap)
 - JavaScript
 - Atom


### Approach
The initial goal was to make a large application that would incorporate a social media presence to it to allow players to communicate with each other. I dedicated a majority of the time to having the maps post when games were created and then into allowing the designated coordinates to populate as markers on the map. One marker being the users position and the second marker being the position of the hosted game.

### Registration
Registration allows you to add a custom avatar as well as view all the other players. This also allows you access to view the created pick up games as well as create and host your own.
